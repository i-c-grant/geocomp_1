* County data
** state box and whiskers of county area
*** narrow and side-by-side, ordered largest to smallest?
*** although box and whisker not really good for states w/ very few counties
*** maybe at a certain cutoff of # of counties, show just as points?
** scatterplot of states: state number of counties vs. average county size
** how to show connection b/w name and region?
*** e.g. Clay in West? Union? Lee? 
*** divide country into regions like buckets
**** rectangle plot?
*** then distribute names of interest across the buckets

** pie chart of number of counties by state
