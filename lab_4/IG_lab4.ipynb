    "## Shape class \n",
    "The Shape class describes shapes using two data structures. Points is a list of Point objects representing the shape (vertices for polygons, center point for circles). Properties is a dict describing the relevant properties of the shape, including side length, area, radius, etc., as appropriate. Finally, the blueprint is a list representing the information provided by the user to construct the shape. This also varies by shape type. Using a list rather than multiple parameters supports eventual extension to other \"blueprint\" formats. For example, the currently supported blueprint for a square is a list containing points representing the two diagonal corners, as this uniquely describes one square. However, this functionality could be extended to support other options, like one point and one vector.\n",
